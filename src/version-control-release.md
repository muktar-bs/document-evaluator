## Version Control and Release Process

## Version Control with GitHub

### Branching Strategy

- **Feature Branches:** Developers create feature branches for implementing new features or fixing bugs. Each feature branch is based on the latest `develop` branch.

- **Develop Branch:** Once the feature is implemented, developers create pull requests (PRs) to merge their feature branches into the `develop` branch for testing and integration.

- **Main Branch:** After thorough testing on the development server, changes from the `develop` branch are merged into the `main` branch for production release.

### Pull Requests and Reviews

- **Feature Development:** Developers create PRs from their feature branches to the `develop` branch. PRs include a clear description of the changes and are reviewed by peers.

- **Testing and Integration:** PRs are reviewed, tested, and integrated into the `develop` branch.

- **Merge to Main:** Once changes are validated on the development server, a PR is created from the `develop` branch to the `main` branch for production release.

## Release Management

### Development Environment

- **Feature Deployment:** Features are deployed to the development server for testing and feedback. The development server is continuously updated with changes from the `develop` branch.

- **Continuous Integration:** Automated CI/CD pipelines trigger builds and deployments for each PR merged into the `develop` branch, ensuring a stable development environment.

### Production Release

- **Main Branch Merge:** When features are ready for production release, a PR is created from the `develop` branch to the `main` branch. This PR undergoes thorough testing and review.

- **Deployment to Production:** Upon approval, changes from the `main` branch are deployed to the production environment. This includes updating the production server with the latest code and configurations.

- **Version Tagging:** After successful deployment, a version tag is applied to the commit on the `main` branch to indicate the release version.

## Continuous Improvement

- **Feedback and Iteration:** Feedback from testing and production usage is incorporated into future development cycles. This iterative process ensures continuous improvement and refinement of the application.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Ongoing monitoring of the production environment helps identify and address issues promptly. Regular maintenance and updates keep the application secure and performant.

By following a structured version control and release process, we ensure code quality, collaboration, and stability throughout the software development lifecycle. This approach enables efficient feature development, rigorous testing, and seamless production releases, ultimately delivering a reliable and high-quality product to our users.
